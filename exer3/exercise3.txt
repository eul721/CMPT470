Status Code: 304 Not Modified

There are fewer response headers in this second request. Whereas the original
request contained information about the content (via Content-Style-Type &
Content-Type & Content-Language), this new response contains none of that. Both
responses have Cache-Control, ETag, Connection, Content-Location, and Expires
headers.

## Redirect

Status Code: 301 Moved Permanently

This response also has fewer headers than the first. It includes a Location header
that indicates where the new page is. This response also has a different Content-Type
and Content-Length.

#Command-Line Requests

Including the `-I` option to `curl` fetches the headers ONLY.
